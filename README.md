# Random Code

This repo contains random code, ranging fron not-working code snippets to full-fledged programs, but that are not enough to get a repo of their own.

## Organization

This repo is seperataed in subfolders, each for a programming language.

> Note that I consider Arduino programming in C++ as its own programming language.

Each language is further subdivized for each project.

## Contributing

You can contribute to this repository, but I ask you to prefix your issue/PR with the language and the project. Example for an issue for the `antiskid` project written in `Arduino`: `Arduino/antiskid: <Issue Title>`.
